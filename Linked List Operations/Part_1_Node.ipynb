    "* And a pointer (an arrow) that tells you where the next box is.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to say, every node has two main parts:\n",
    "* **Data** — the actual value it holds (e.g., 5, \"apple\")\n",

    "A **Node** is the core unit of many data structures, consisting of data and a reference (or link) to another node. Nodes are essential for creating dynamic and flexible structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs. Unlike arrays, they don’t need contiguous memory, making operations like insertion and deletion more efficient. Data structures such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees rely heavily on nodes for organizing and connecting data. Mastering nodes provides a foundation for understanding complex structures and algorithms, enabling efficient data manipulation and memory usage. Understanding how nodes link together is key to building structures where order, connection, and navigation are crucial. Nodes form the backbone of many algorithms and real-world programming systems.\n"
