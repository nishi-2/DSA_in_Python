This repository is to store the Data Structure and Algorithm logics in python in detail.

The uniqueness about this repository is in the way of building the Linked List structure. I believe in modular approach of solving problems.
No matter how small the function body is, with proper naming and usage intension it makes things easier.

The intent is to help you learn and remember DSA in easy way, as I myself has found difficulty in it.
